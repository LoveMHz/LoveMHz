Nothing much else to post for today. Jazz Jackrabbit makes it ingame now, but
still having issues with the controller. If I can't sort it out tonight then
it's back to work on XeDebug for abit.

### Update

I've managed to sort out the controller issues. (Issue with threads, whoops
^_^). Now I'm down to two bugs. Dieing and beating the level both cause crashes.
Not that huge of a bug, in terms of fixing. So hopefully if everything goes as
planned then OpenJazz360 will be released tomorrow.
