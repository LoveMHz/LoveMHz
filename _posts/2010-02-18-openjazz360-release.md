I'm proud to finial release the first version of OpenJazz360, based off of the
OpenJazz project. As stated already this is the first version so please don't
kill me if you run into any bugs. Simple just leave me note in the comments.

**About**  
Jazz Jackrabbit is a platform game produced by Epic MegaGames. The game features
six episodes; each episode consists of three worlds, with two levels and a boss
level. Jazz has a life bar; when enemies shoot or come in contact with him, he
loses health that must be replenished by collecting carrots. If his health falls
to zero, Jazz turns to ash and the level restarts from the last checkpoint. Also,
instead of jumping on enemies Jazz must shoot his enemies with a blue gun he
always carries. A variety of different bullet types can be found in the game and
do varying amounts of damage.

**Install**  
Run like any other XEX on your 360. The shareware files are included. If you
own the full game simply copy the files into the OpenJazz360 folder.
