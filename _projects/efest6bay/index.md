**Description**

Go library for interacting with the Efest Bluetooth enabled 6 bay battery
charger. The goal of this project is to identify, reverse engineer, and evaluate
the safety of this device. Through this process Iâ€™ll also be writing a simple
interface library in Go as a working exercise in my pursuit to become more
efficient in this new programming language.
