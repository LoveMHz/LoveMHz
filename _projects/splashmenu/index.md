**Description**

SplashMenu was developed by myself through a partnership with RankAboveOthers
whom provided marketing resources and financial support. SplashMenu is a web
platform based point of sales application. It easily allows restaurants to
integrate an complete online experience for customers to order food from their
favorite restaurants.

<!-- Site Design   Software Design   Hardware Design -->

**Features**
* Beautiful and Seamless Integration – Restaurant menu generating plugin can
easily integrate seamlessly with nearly any WordPress theme without creating a
design or functional conflict. A standalone version was also available for
non-WordPress based sites.
* Manage Multiple Locations – SplashMenu supports an unlimited number of
locations, per licenses terms, with each allowing for customization.
* Powerful Settings and Controls – When customers order online, their
information is stored and will automatically load the next time they book again
with the same email address.
* Customer Privacy Enabled – You can manage your company contact info, staff,
locations, entrée/food, online orders, review past orders and even easily accept
payments online.
* Offer Delivery Services – When a returning customer enters their email address
to place an order, their last name, phone number and physical address are
automatically concealed.
* Give Staff Access – Our restaurant menu generating plugin can easily integrate
seamlessly with nearly any WordPress theme without creating a design or
functional conflict.
* Track Orders Online – If you have managers or other staff in place to help you
run your business, you can grant them separate access to monitor and manage
orders online.

**Challenges**
* Supporting multiple payment gateway systems through an expandable system. Such
as 2Checkout, Authorize.net, PayPal, and SecurePay.
* Securely manage multi-tenant cloud based application.
* Allow customers target development branches, while migrating data
automatically between them. This allowed users to test out beta branches or stay
on minor release branches for compatibility reasons.
* Developed a full client SDK including examples. themes, and documentation. A
key part of the SDK was providing a universal layer between different API target
branches.
* Advanced caching mechanism for reducing heavy load spikes on client’s sites.
* Development of POS hardware based around existing commodity x86 hardware.
* Porting the Android Operating System to existing x86 based POS registers.
* Reverse engineering of x86 based POS registers.
* Writing Linux drivers of x86 POS hardware.
