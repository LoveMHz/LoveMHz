**Description**
The Sugar and Vine website was developed while working as CTO of WorkforceHQ in
partnership with Jola Interactive in 2011. The joint effort was divided with
Joal Interactive taking the task of brand strategy and planning, while Workforce
HQ did design and development.

Site Design

**Challenges**
* Redesigning the Magento backend with a more simplified interface focused on
allowing the client quick and easy access to managing products, inventory,
sales, etc.
* Creating a simplified ‘accessory’ option for products. Allowing customers to
easily choose charms to go with bracelets and other items was a critical part of
Sugar and Vine‘s business model.
* In-depth social media sharing integration.
