**Description**

SEO Analysis Generator was developed by myself through a partnership with
RankAboveOthers whom provided marketing resources and knowledge base on SEO
tactics. SEO Analysis Generator is a tool for generating detailed reports on
websites about their Google SEO ranking, along with helpful information on how
to improve their siteâ€™s ranking. This tool was sold to web development companies
as a way to quickly generate reports for their clients illustrating possible
work their site needed.
