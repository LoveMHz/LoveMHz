**Description**

SplashAll was developed by myself through a partnership with RankAboveOthers
whom provided research, designs, and financing. The project came along from the
need of a proper project management solution for companies small and large.

creation and so on. SplashAll helps professional firms and small businesses
accomplish their everyday projects with a more suitable process.
